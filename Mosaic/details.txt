Project:
Using Computer Vision theory and having a set of 500 images(resolution: 40x28) that illustrates a different flower,
this program gets, as input, the path of the a color image and creates, based on the color image, a mosaic composed of some images
of the set of flower images in order to look like to the original color image.
